# Installation ubuntu desktop 🐧🐧

Go to the website [ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop) and download the system setup file. By clicking on the "Download" button, you will download an ISO (ubuntu-22.04.1-desktop-amd64.iso) file to your computer - a so-called system image.

---

The downloaded image must be loaded onto a pendrive, which will make it bootable.

---

In the computer BIOS, the option should be set to yes, So that the hardware starts with the media that is plugged into the USB port.

---

If all is successful, you should see a message on the screen. Select the first option: Ubuntu

---

When the installer interface appears on the screen, select English from the list on the left. The entire installation process will be in English. There are two options to choose from: Try and install Ubuntu.

> When you select "choose to "choose Ubuntu", the system will load from a pen and you will be able to. The difference is that the settings and changes you make in this test session will not be made. You can also run the System Setup during a test session and install it permanently system on the disk.

---

The next installation step is where the system is installed and the selected option is appropriate for the hardware. Select "Disk Cleanup and Install Ubuntu".

---

The installer will ask you to set the region. However, you have previously indicated that you are speaking in English, so the system should customize the required region. So if everything on the screen is correct, click on the “Next” button.

---

The installer will now proceed to identify the system user by asking you to give the computer name, account name, and password. When asked if you would like to ask for a password at startup, select yes because this increases the security of the system. Then click “Next”.
> User name and surname: your_name your_surname

> Computer name: computer_name / ubuntu_desktop

> Username: your_name

> Password: your_password

> Confirm your password: your_password

> Require a password to log in
